# Overview
This application uses webscraping to create an API which stores the data of each pokemon in the pokedex database.
All together it was built with Express JS, Node JS, Puppeteer, with React being the framework. 

# Searching:
The search bow utilizes a autocomplete component that helps the user from typing as much as possible.
It also helps if they forget the specific pokemon's name they are trying to search.

# Webscraping
I used Puppeteer to webscrape the data from the official Pokédex Database. If I wanted to take it a step further it can also enter every specific Pokémon page.
This would allow me to return more detailed data such as height, weight, and even which videogames the Pokémon appear in.
